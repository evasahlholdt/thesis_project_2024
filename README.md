## TLDR 

This thesis covers the subject of utilizing generative adversarial network (GANs) for the problem of generating synthetic time series data, specifically electroenchalography (EEG) in the temporal domain. 

Synthetic EEG is generated for data augmentation in a left- and right-hand **motor imagery (MI)** classification task. 

For data generation, a GAN model called **DoppelGANger** (DG) proposed as a generalizable framework for multivariate time series is used (Lin et al., 2020). 

The **main interest** of the current work is to explore whether high-fidelity synthetic EEG can be generated from raw EEG data in the temporal domain using a general-purpose time series GAN such as DG.
